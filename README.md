This repository contains an implementation of the paper:

> Kazemi, Vahid, and Josephine Sullivan. "One millisecond face alignment with an ensemble of regression trees." Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (CVPR), 2014 IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2014.

This code is a port of *dlib* implementaion (http://dlib.net/) to use OpenCV (2.4/3.x).
