LIBQP - Library for Quadratic Programming


INTRODUCTION

LIBQP implements methods for solving two special instances of QP tasks:

1. QP task with simplex constraints (subset of variables lie in a simplex). 
See function ./lib/libqp_splx.c for definition of the QP task. 
The solver is a generalization of the method proposed [1] and [2]. 
Solving this QP task is required for example in machine learning methods like 
structured SVM learning, Bundle Methods for Risk Minimization, binary SVM 
with L2-soft margin, etc. 

2. QP task with box constraints and a single linear equality constraint. 
See function ./lib/libqp_gsmo.c for definition of the QP task. 
This task is solvable by the Generalized Sequential Minimal Optimizer [3].
The solver is exact implementation of the algorithm from [3].
Solving this QP task is required for example when training binary SVM with 
L1-soft margin.
