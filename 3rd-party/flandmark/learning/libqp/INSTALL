MATLAB

1. Run Matlab and go to the folder libqp_root/matlab

  cd libqp_root/matlab

2. Compile mex files by running

  libqp_compile

Now you can use libqp_splx and libqp_gsmo solvers located in
libqp_root/matlab. To make these function visible from Matlab you 
need to add 

    addpath('libqp_root/matlab')

to your startup.m file. 

To test the solvers run scripts
  libqp_splx_test
  libqp_gsmo_test


EXAMPLE APPLICATION

1. Go to the folder libqp_root/examples

    cd libqp_root/examples

2. Issue make 

    make

Now you can run test script

    ./run_test
